Boilerplate for WordPress Themes

SCSS dependencies included in CodeKit config file. Optionally compile assets in command line if no access to CodeKit.

This is for custom themes that break the regular WordPress structure; because of this, a "home" template has been created. The read settings must be changed to reflect this.
